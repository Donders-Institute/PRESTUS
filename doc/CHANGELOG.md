## v0.6.1
*(2026-05-22)*

Extends the calibration pipeline with a unified entry point, parametric model store, and HPC dispatch. Introduces async multi-transducer simulations, a sequential simulation dispatcher, PlanTUS-based automated placement, and RAS as the canonical coordinate space. Drops the Image Processing Toolbox requirement.

#### Core / Config
- MATLAB Image Processing Toolbox no longer required — morphological ops and resampling use base-MATLAB equivalents
- `transducer.target_isppa_wcm2` migrated from calibration struct to transducer struct
- Optional `transducer.name` field added to transducer config

#### Calibration
- Unified `calibrate_transducer` entry point with HPC dispatch, multi-intensity mode, and parametric model store
- Geometric steering mode with per-element hardware correction
- Multiple analytical forward models — O'Neil and Rayleigh
- Transducer library (draft)
- Free-water correction moved post-analytical to make optional
- Free-water validation can be deactivated or limited to first/last target ISPPA
- Pluggable analytical forward model interface
- Option to use manufacturer phases to initiate global search (`opt_use_initial_phases`)
- ⚠️ **Fixed:** amplitude scaling bug present since early PRESTUS versions — correction factor is the square root of intensity ratios, not the ratio itself

#### Placement
- PlanTUS placement mode wraps the external PlanTUS optimiser for automated transducer targeting — **experimental** (see [doc_placement_plantus.md](doc_placement_plantus.md))
- T1 overlay plot auto-generated after heuristic and PlanTUS placement
- Browser-based transducer alignment viewer (*experimental*)

#### Acoustic/Thermal
- Async multi-transducer pipeline — **experimental** (see [doc_async_transducer.md](doc_async_transducer.md))
- Sequential simulation dispatcher: runs multiple parameter configurations in series, chains thermal simulations, and produces a consolidated multi-run report (see [doc_advanced.md](doc_advanced.md))
- ⚠️ **Fixed:** sequential simulation produced incorrect outputs prior to this release due to mismatching grid->T1w transforms and back of the adopted heatmaps; the heatmaps were not interpolated with the baseline free-water value leading to interpolation artefacts
- Uncertainty pipeline produces uncertainty bands across sequential multi-run parameter sweeps
- Complex pressure field optionally saved (`save_p_complex`) (*experimental*)

#### Head pipeline
- RAS established as canonical entry-point coordinate space; RAS+ orientation enforced at NIfTI load time; `ras_plus` grid mode rescales without rotation
- `tissuemask_binary` exposes a `water` mask field
- `smooth_img` gains an `off` method (no smoothing); exposed in GUI

#### Phantom
- `trans_pos_mm` / `focus_pos_mm` config fields allow resolution-independent transducer and focus position specification
- ⚠️ **Fixed:** phantom NIfTI outputs used incorrect voxel dimensions and inconsistent world-space orientation across pipeline stages

#### NIfTI / Transform
- Batched `tformarray` with optional parallel workers for MNI transforms
- Explicit FOV mask used in MNI outputs instead of zero sentinel (unreliable for pCT Hounsfield values)
- ⚠️ **Fixed:** pCT path layout corrected; NaN padding used instead of zero fill

#### Telemetry
- System resources reported at run start: OS, CPU model/cores, RAM, GPU, CUDA version

## v0.6.0 
*(2026-04-30)*

Introduces matrix transducer support, an uncertainty quantification pipeline, and a rudimentary GUI. The pipeline is further integrated with automated pCT generation, placement dispatch, multi-ISPPA targeting, and a BIDS-inspired output structure. Parameter names and output paths have changed throughout.

> ⚠️ **Migration note:** Several parameter names and all output paths have changed in this release. Existing configs and post-processing scripts will need updating.
>
> **Parameters:**
> - `parameters.submit_medium` renamed to `parameters.platform`
> - Segmentation smoothing now specified in FWHM mm (parameter name changed)
> - Transducer field suffixes renamed consistently — check transducer config fields
> - Further parameter renames throughout — consult `config_default.yaml` for current names
>
> **Output paths:**
> - `parameters.io` fields renamed: `*_dir` → `dir_*`, `*_filename` → `filename_*`
> - Preprocessing cache files follow a consistent `res_N_descriptor` naming scheme
> - `space-` prefix removed from all NIfTI output filenames
> - `output_affix` now appended at the end of all output filenames
> - HPC log directory renamed: `hpc_log/` → `log_hpc/`
> - Outputs reorganised into BIDS-inspired typed subdirectories (`acoustic/`, `thermal/`, `cache/`, `debug/`, etc.)
>
> **Directory and config naming:**
> - `toolboxes/` directory renamed to `external/`
> - Config files consistently prefixed with `config_`

#### Added

- [**feature**] Uncertainty quantification pipeline (see [doc_uncertainty.md](doc_uncertainty.md))
    - Three-variant simulation workflow (default / liberal / conservative medium properties) producing a unified HTML report with per-metric safety cards colour-coded against ITRUSST non-significant risk limits, acoustic and thermal range tables, side-by-side intensity and temperature maps, and an SVG temperature timeseries with uncertainty band
    - Supports MATLAB (sequential) and HPC (parallel, scheduler-dependent) execution with automatic resumption from partial runs
- [**feature**] Matrix transducer support (see [doc_transducer.md](doc_transducer.md), [PR #117](https://github.com/Donders-Institute/PRESTUS/pull/117))
    - Flexible element layout options: rectangular grid, Fibonacci, Fermat spiral, and Clover multi-array configuration
    - Element positions can be defined inline or loaded from file
- [**pCT**] pCT generation fully automated inside the pipeline; a T1w image, UTE image, and mapping algorithm are sufficient — pre-generation remains possible for debugging; pCT section included in HTML report when used
- [**calibration**] In-pipeline amplitude calibration to target ISPPA
- [**feature**] Multi-ISPPA targeting — run acoustics once, scale to N independent thermal targets via post-hoc pressure scaling (see [doc_multi_isppa.md](doc_multi_isppa.md))
- [**thermal**] Dual CEM43 output: both kWave and ISO formulations propagated through pipeline, CSV, NIfTIs, and report
- [**report**] ISO CEM43 shown in Exposure Dashboard and methods section when enabled
- [**feature**] Placement dispatch — unified entry point for manual, Localite, and heuristic transducer positioning (see [doc_placement.md](doc_placement.md))
- [**feature**] `prestus_config_init` — bootstraps a project-specific config directory and `config_default.yaml`; `load_parameters` now resolves the project config automatically so PRESTUS can be called from any working directory
- [**neuronav**] Unified Localite pipeline via `localite_matrix_to_positions`; `InstrumentMarker` support added; `tracker_to_bowl_mm` parameter
- [**feature**] PRESTUS GUI — tabbed parameter editor and simulation launcher (see [doc_gui.md](doc_gui.md))
- [**feature**] `prestus_group_start` — new entry point for group-level MNI-space analysis
- [**feature**] `segmentation_only` pipeline mode
- [**report**] MItc (mechanical index transcranial) reported across all intracranial tissues
- [**thermal**] `simulation.log_thermal_updates` — suppress verbose per-step k-Wave progress output (default: off)
- [**refactor**] `simulation_nifti` split into per-pipeline-stage calls; bone mask separated from pseudoCT NIfTIs
- [**telemetry**] Opt-in anonymous usage telemetry (disabled by default; see [doc_telemetry.md](doc_telemetry.md))

#### Changed

- [**I/O**] Subject-specific output subfolders enforced
- [**output**] Intensity output naming cleaned up: redundant `max` labels removed; naming aligned with standardised pressure and intensity metric conventions
- [**grid**] `pml_size` defaults to `'auto'`; effective PML size resolved and tracked in log
- [**config**] `simulation.debug` defaults to `0`; property-map and MNI NIfTI export flags added to `config_default.yaml`
- [**validation**] Function inputs consistently validated via MATLAB `arguments` blocks; `help <function>` exposes header information inline
- [**report**] Safety Dashboard renamed to **Exposure Dashboard**; water-medium limits now populated; pressure units corrected; dynamic pressure display added; CEM and temperature removed from water-medium report

#### Fixed

- [**paths**] `load_parameters` resolves `config_default.yaml` via an absolute path, preventing stray output folders
- [**paths**] Cross-platform SimNIBS path compatibility
- [**transducer**] Annular array element format and default thickness corrected
- [**nifti**] Property map export: corrected datatype mismatch, scalar `alpha_power` handling, and `FillValue` assignment
- [**hpc**] Transducer index suffix omitted from positioning filenames for single-transducer runs
- [**plots**] T1 intensity overlay orientation corrected using NIfTI sform; deprecated `LineSmoothing` property removed
- [**logging**] Post-hoc water simulation writes to its own independent log file; PPW warning no longer emits a backtrace
- [**debug**] Debug directory creation and plots skipped when `simulation.debug = 0`

> - `layer_labels` renamed to `layers`
> - Transducer and focus position fields renamed to `trans_pos` / `focus_pos` consistently
> - `grid_step_m` and `default_grid_size` removed
> - Grid expansion parameter renamed
> - Attenuation parameters renamed — consult `config_default.yaml`
> - Layer indexing field migrated from `layers` to `medium` throughout
> - Pipeline refactored into discrete processing stages — consult the documentation for current function entry points
