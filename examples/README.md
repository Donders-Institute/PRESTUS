# Example scripts

This folder contains example scripts that call the PRESTUS pipeline (currently with fixed paths) and examples of acoustic profiles. These need to be replaced with acoustic profiles for the transduers that should be simulated (often provided as part of the manufacturer's documentation, but can also be based on personal free-water measurements).

An example of a possible way to use these scrips for acoustic and heating simulations is provided as a DataLad dataset at https://gin.g-node.org/PRESTUS/sim_ernie/.

A simplified 2D benchmarking example can be found [here](https://github.com/jkosciessa/PRESTUS_2D_demo).

# TO DO: document / provide updated example scripts
