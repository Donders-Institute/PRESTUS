# Example scripts

This folder contains a mixture of scripts that call the PRESTUS pipeline (currently with fixed paths) and examples of acoustic profiles for varying transducers. These need to be replaced with acoustic profiles for the transduers that should be simulated (often provided as part of the manufacturer's documentation, but can also be based on personal free-water measurements).

An example of a possibel way to sue these scrips for acoustic and heating simulations is provided as a DataLad dataset at https://gin.g-node.org/PRESTUS/sim_ernie/.

# TO DO: document example scripts
