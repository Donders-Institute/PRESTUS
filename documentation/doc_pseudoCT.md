# PseudoCT

PRESTUS supports the use of UTE-based images as a source of pseudo-Hounsfield units. 
This is currently only implemented for layered setups.

### Creating a pseudoCT from UTE scans

```create_pseudoCT.sh``` creates a pseudoCT and an associated mask file starting from a T1w and a PETRA UTE image. 

To run the code you will need to install:
- SimNIBS
- FSL
- ANTs

How to make a pseudoCT:

1) run the SimNIBS segmentation using a T1 and a PETRA UTE scan (instead of T2) as inputs. 
    - You can either use the SimNIBS GUI or PRESTUS (**default**).
2) run in bash `create_pseudoCT.sh`
    - create_pseudoCT.sh calls the MATLAB function find_soft_tissue_peak

The pseudoCT will be deposited in the `m2m` folder alongside the SimNIBS segmentation. 

The following is an example script that you can use for a `create_pseudoCT.sh` call.

```
#!/bin/bash

rootpath="$(pwd)/.."
rootpath=$(builtin cd $rootpath; pwd)

# Load necessary modules
module load ants
module load matlab
module load fsl

# Change directory to the scripts directory
scriptpath=${rootpath}/tools/PRESTUS/functions
cd "${scriptpath}" || { echo "Directory not found"; exit 1; }

# Source the script containing the function
source ${scriptpath}/create_pseudoCT.sh

subject_id="001" # 'sub-' will automatically be added
m2m_path=${rootpath}/data/simnibs

# Call the create_pseudoCT function
create_pseudoCT "$subject_id" "$m2m_path" "${scriptpath}"
```

### Starting acoustic + thermal simulations using pseudoCT

see [this issue](https://github.com/Donders-Institute/PRESTUS/issues/43)

To inform skull properties by pCTs in simulations, set `parameters.usepseudoCT = 1`.
The current code supports the following variants to use pCTs to inform tissue parameters.
They are specified via `parameters.pseudoCT_variant`.

- `carpino` | (**default**) Algorithm described in Carpino et al. (2024). <br>

    All subsequent steps are only applied inside the skull mask.
    - The k-Wave function hounsfield2density converts pseudo-HUs to density. 
    - Original pseudoCT values are initially shifted by 1000 and thresholded at 0 to exclude air voxels. 
    - Resulting density values are regularized to a minimum of the specified water density [originally: 1]. 
    - The sound speed c is calculated from density ùúå using the linear relationship: c = 1.33ùúå + 167. This is identical to the [k-Plan estimation](https://dispatch.k-plan.io/static/docs/simulation-pipeline.html#evaluating-plans).
    - The absorption coefficient ùõº is derived from HU values according to formula (3) in Yaakub et al; the offset of 1000 for pseudo-HUs is removed prior to entering the formula.

- `yakuub` | Algorithm specified in Yaakub et al. (2023). <br>

    For both variants, ùõº is bounded based on estimates made at 500 kHz (i.e., ùõº(f); see Aubry, J.-F., 2022 for prior benchmark simulations). We actually require ```alpha_0``` in ```ùõº(f) = alpha_0 x f[MHz] ^ y```. We estimate ```alpha_0 = ùõº(f)/0.5^y``` with  ```y``` being the specified ```alpha_power_true```for the skull tissue.

- `k-plan` | Algorithm described in Carpino et al. (2024) with more fixed skull tissue properties akin to k-Plan <br>

    k-Plan fixes the absorption coeff. to `13.3` and power law to `1`. To allow more flexibility, this variant reads in the alpha power values specified for the respective bone segmentation (`trabecular` or `cortical`) from the current config. To replicate k-Plan's setup, `alpha_0 = 13.3` and `alpha_power_true = 1` should be specified in the config for all bone segmentations.
    
    Heating will use the acoustic simulation initially, and then overwrite bone density (= `1850`) and sound speed (= `1.33 x 1850 + 166.7`) prior to running the heating simulation.
