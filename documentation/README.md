# PRESTUS: PREprocessing & Simulations for Transcranial Ultrasound Stimulation

PRESTUS (PREprocessing & Simulations for Transcranial Ultrasound Stimulation) is an open-source MATLAB toolbox that aims to streamline imaging-informed simulations of Transcanial Ultrasound Stimulation (TUS): from the segmentation of T1-weighted MRI head scans and mapping of medium tissue properties (possibly informed for skull via (pseudo-)CT images) in a simulation grid, to the execution of acoustic and thermal simulations using the widely adopted k-Wave engine. High-performance computing (HPC) support via SLURM and CentOS enables efficient parallelization, and large-scale analyses. Output 3D NifTI images are automatically mapped to a standard template (MNI) space to facilitate group reporting.

Key features include:

- Automated MRI segmentation (using SimNIBS 4 charm) and preprocessing.
- 2D / 3D grid setup.
- Multi-layer medium property mapping (water, skin, multi-layer skull, and brain).
- (pseudo-)CT-informed continuous skull mapping.
- Virtual multi-element transducer calibration (free-water profile emulation).
- Estimation of entry-target coordinates.
- Flexible temporal protocol specification (e.g., including session breaks).
- k-Wave integration for robust acoustic and heating simulations.
- Support for high-performance computing.
- 3D NifTI outputs for major reporting metrics (in subject- & MNI-space).

These features make PRESTUS an accessible tool for researchers to plan, validate, and report transcranial ultrasound targeting.

# Installation

Follow the [installation guide](doc_installation.md).

### Versions

PRESTUS is under active development. The default `main` branch is considered more stable. The [`development` branch](https://github.com/Donders-Institute/PRESTUS/tree/development) may contain both new features and stability updates, but is subject to more dynamic changes. [Releases](https://github.com/Donders-Institute/PRESTUS/releases) bundle major updates and are associated with a version number. Starting in PRESTUS v0.5 logs will print the git hash when PRESTS has been cloned as a git repository.
